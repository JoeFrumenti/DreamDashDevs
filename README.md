Game Devs: Joe Frumenti, Hannah Wigh, and Sam Tancio 
Date completed: 5/5/2022 (except we are going to keep working on it so not really)

Theres a lot of technically interesting things in here, but to keep it short, we implemented some trignonometry/geometry 
to make pathing for the enemy ghosts. There is also some linear algebra/newtonian physics/vector math stuff going on in 
the player's movement, which we used to make the player glide with a set variable used for accelleration. We also implemented
parallax scrolling, which was suprisingly difficult. The game was also made in Unity, which is much more technically 
difficult to use than Phaser but has a lot more capabilities

We are proud of our art because the specific techniques we used were new to us. We were both new to running 
animations as well as repeating backgrounds. None of us really had a background in working with sounds so we are 
very proud with how our music and sound effects turned out. One of our artists used their trackpad to produce their 
art. We are happy with how our art turned out even with the lack of tools. Our other artist had never made any music or sound effects before,
and learned all of the tools that she used from scratch to make sound effects and a looping song.
